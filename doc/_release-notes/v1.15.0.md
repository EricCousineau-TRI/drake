## Mathematical Program

<!-- <relnotes for solvers go here> -->

* [feature] TBD add convenience overloads for AddIndeterminates ([#18992][_#18992])  # add convenience overloads for AddIndeterminates
* [feature] TBD [solvers] MathematicalProgram adds and stores QuadraticConstraint ([#19016][_#19016])  # Currently only the nonlinear solvers IPOPT/SNOPT/NLOPT handles QuadraticConstraint.
* [fix] TBD [solvers] MathematicalProgram AddDecisionVariables and AddIndeterminates allow duplicated variables ([#19087][_#19087])  # Previously it throws an error if the input contains variables overlapping with the ones already in the MathematicalProgram. Now it just ignores these variables and only add the variables the MathematicalProgram hasn't seen yet.

## Multibody Dynamics and Geometry

<!-- <relnotes for geometry,multibody go here> -->

* [fix] TBD [parsing] Allow duplicate geometry names in URDF input ([#19029][_#19029])
* [feature] TBD [multibody,tools] [parsing] Add support for remote packages ([#18955][_#18955])
* [feature] TBD [geometry,multibody] [meshcat] Hoist recording logic from MeshcatVisualizer to Meshcat ([#18433][_#18433])  # Towards #17832 -- with this PR we now support recording contact visualization in meshcat animations (only not the hydroelastic surface visualization yet).  Previously, contact forces did not appear in any animations. Previously the recording logic lived in the System (MeshcatVisualizer), because it was the system that knows about time. But this became unwieldy... as more systems wanted to contribute to the animation (for instance the contact visualizer, the point cloud visualizer, my manipulation class meshcat writer, ...), I had to start writing a significant amount of custom recording-specific logic in each subsystem. (I do have a working experimental branch in which I made this possible through a recording output port on the MeshcatVisualizer... but the burden on every downstream visualizer was too great). In this PR I've hoisted the recording logic from MeshcatVisualizer into the main Meshcat class.  SetTransform and SetProperty can take an additional optional input for time_in_recording. If a user has called StartRecording, then any future calls to SetTransform/SetProperty with the time included will be recorded.
* [fix] TBD [geometry,visualization] [visualization] By default, Meshcat proximity geometry is hidden ([#19058][_#19058])
* [fix] TBD [geometry,systems,multibody,visualization] Add names to visualization systems (when possible) ([#19075][_#19075])
* [fix] TBD [parsing] Error out if <drake:diffuse_map> is specified in a URDF ([#19066][_#19066])
* [fix] TBD Fix the ordering of the Delassus operator approximation ([#19082][_#19082])
* [newly deprecated fix] TBD [geometry,systems] [geometry] Make namespace of all three RenderEngine consistent ([#18877][_#18877])  # I.e., have all public interfaces under `geometry` namespace and all the implementation details under `geometry/render_*/internal`.
* [fix] TBD [geometry,visualization] [visualization] Show hydro tesselation for proximity shapes ([#19085][_#19085])
* [fix] TBD [parsing] Don't warn on equivalent package.xml files ([#19111][_#19111])  # In a bazel runfiles tree, we might have package.xml files that are symlinks to other locations but where the directory is just a bucket of symlinks and not the actual package directory. This is typical situation and should not generate a console warning.
* [fix] TBD [parsing] Fix mujoco default mesh name heuristic ([#19124][_#19124])
* [fix] TBD [parsing] Don't abort on invalid input ([#19125][_#19125])  # Add missing IsValid check to the AddModelInstance directive. DRAKE_DEMAND is an inappropriate tool to reject malformed input. We should prefer exceptions rather than taking down the whole Python interpreter. Now that GetModelInstanceByName has a nice error message, we should rely on that rather than an ahead-of-time check in the parser.
* [fix] TBD [geometry] Ignore trailing whitespace in mtl files ([#19129][_#19129])
* [feature] TBD [geometry,workspace] Implements WriteObj() for VPolytope ([#19117][_#19117])
* [fix] TBD Python bindings for SpatialInertia geometries ([#19134][_#19134])  # Co-Authored-By: mitiguy <paul.mitiguy@tri.global>
* [fix] TBD [visualization] Hide near-zero hydroelastic force or moment ([#19112][_#19112])
* [feature] TBD New SpatialInertia factory method SolidBoxWithMass() ([#19141][_#19141])  # Co-Authored-By: mitiguy <paul.mitiguy@tri.global>
* [fix] TBD [multibody,systems] [parsing] Provide name suggestions when dmd frames have typos ([#19154][_#19154])  # By calling "Has" or "Maybe", we were losing out on the plant's nice exception messages with suggestions. Fix lack of model instance name guard in the maybe flavor.
* [feature] TBD Implements MultibodyPlant::GetPositionNames() ([#19162][_#19162])  # Towards #10736, to help with MultibodyPlant introspection.
* [fix feature] TBD [parsing] Port mujoco parser to diagnostic policy ([#19157][_#19157])  # This patch updates most of the mujoco parser diagnostics to include file and line number, and to obey policy configuration from the top-level Parser. In addition, it fixes a bug found trying to use std::optional<bool> for a tri-state variable -- one dropped '*' in the wrong place led to an unreachable branch, and probably other problems. Finally, it moves the affected files closer to clang-format compliance.

## Planning

<!-- <relnotes for planning go here> -->

* [fix] TBD hotfix for direct_collocation_constraint_test memcheck failure ([#19056][_#19056])
* [feature] TBD Support passing MathematicalProgram to DirectCollocation constructor ([#19156][_#19156])  # This enables adding multiple direct collocation programs into the same MathematicalProgram, which is important for enabling e.g. hybrid trajectory optimization. This has been a TODO, and was a major reason that we switched MultipleShooting to has-a prog (from is-a prog).

## Tutorials and examples

<!-- <relnotes for examples,tutorials go here> -->

* [fix] TBD [examples] Remove unused atlas scene objects (blocks, etc.) ([#19159][_#19159])
* [fix] TBD Move meshes and models into drake_models ([#19160][_#19160])  # Upgrade drake_models to latest commit.
* TBD

## Miscellaneous features and fixes

<!-- <relnotes for common,math,lcm,lcmtypes,manipulation,perception,visualization go here> -->

* [fix] TBD [yaml] Add filename, line, and column to error messages ([#18952][_#18952])
* [feature] TBD [perception] PointCloud can morph its fields after construction ([#18987][_#18987])  # Prior to this PR, the `Fields` of a PointCloud object is determined at construction time, and doesn't allow any morphing after that. An exception will be thrown if one attempts to copy/move-assign a PointCloud with a different `Fields` to another. However, the same PointCloud can be used to copy/move-construct another Pointcloud. This PR tries to make the behavior consistent and avoid confusions for users.
* [feature] TBD Support passing a meshcat instance to ApplyDefaultVisualization ([#19048][_#19048])
* [feature] TBD [common,multibody,geometry,tools,lcm,doc,examples] Add DRAKE_ALLOW_NETWORK governor ([#19050][_#19050])  # For unit tests, default it to only allow meshcat. Tests that want broader network access need to opt-in.
* [fix] TBD [math] Move code from rotation_matrix.h to cc ([#19040][_#19040])  # Sanity-check the theta arg to MakeRotationMatrixZ(), etc. Co-authored-by: mitiguy <paul.mitiguy@tri.global>
* [fix] TBD [common] Add missing Python kwarg for Polynomial constructor ([#19063][_#19063])  # Modernize Polynomial coding style for coefficients get and set. Fail-fast in Release builds when given a 2D matrix of coefficients.
* [feature] TBD Add RpyDtFromAngularVelocityInChild() ([#19018][_#19018])  # Co-Authored-By: mitiguy <paul.mitiguy@tri.global>
* [feature] TBD [trajectories] PiecewisePolynomial supports serialization ([#19062][_#19062])  # Enhance yaml.py to avoid calling getattr unnecessarily.
* [feature] TBD Adds `CompositeTrajectory` ([#19163][_#19163])  # In particular, we need composite Bezier curves as the output of the upcoming GCS trajectory optimization code. Also adds python bindings for this class and for BezierCurve.
* TBD

## pydrake bindings

<!-- <relnotes for bindings go here> -->

* [fix] TBD [pydrake] Add more bindings for InverseDynamics & MultibodyPlant ([#19031][_#19031])
* [fix] TBD [py tree] Bind set_default_damping for RevoluteJoint, PrismaticJoint ([#19015][_#19015])
* [fix] TBD [py plant] Bind AddDistanceConstraint and AddBallConstraint ([#19026][_#19026])  # Co-authored-by: Jeremy Nimmer <jeremy.nimmer@tri.global>
* [feature] TBD Add Python bindings to CalcRpyDtFromAngularVelocityInChild() ([#19074][_#19074])  # Co-Authored-By: mitiguy <paul.mitiguy@tri.global>
* [fix] TBD Adds python binding for Polynomial<T>::EvaluateUnivariate() ([#19118][_#19118])
* [fix] TBD [model_visualizer] Don't crash on a failed reload ([#19014][_#19014])
* [fix] TBD [visualization] Enhance model_visualizer command line ([#19131][_#19131])  # Support multiple files, and so enable auto-renaming in ModelVisualizer's parser. This helps direct users of the class as well; now they can call AddModels multiple times without trouble. Allow passing a url= to ModelVisualizer.AddModels, and simplify the main program to take advantage of this. Obey BUILD_WORKSPACE_DIRECTORY for relative paths during 'bazel run'.
* [fix] TBD Improve error message for namedview ([#19148][_#19148])  # Previously, setting a bad attribute just said "Cannot add attributes!" Now it says, e.g.  "Cannot add attributes! The fields in this named view are ('a', 'b'), but you tried to set 'c'."
* [feature] TBD [visualization] Add frame (aka triad) visualization function ([#19152][_#19152])
* [feature] TBD Python bind SpatialInertia::SolidBoxWithMass() ([#19172][_#19172])

## Build system

<!-- <relnotes for cmake,doc,setup,third_party,tools go here> -->

* [fix] TBD [doc,setup,tools,workspace] Upgrade to Bazel 6.1.1 ([#19012][_#19012])
* [fix] TBD [tools,setup] [setup] Upgrade from clang-12 to clang-14 on Ubuntu ([#19030][_#19030])
* [fix] TBD [tools,multibody,workspace,common] [parsing] Switch drake_models to a remote package ([#19046][_#19046])  # Drake's installation (and therefore packaged binaries) no longer embeds large models (e.g., meshes for franka, jaco, wsg, ycb, etc.). Instead, the RobotLocomotion/models repository is downloaded on demand the first time any one of those model paths is accessed. The download is cached locally, so only the very first access will pay the cost.
* [feature] TBD Add tool for converting obj to sdf ([#18886][_#18886])  # This provides more configuration knobs for creating the model than simply parsing the obj directly into MbP via Parser. Co-authored-by: Jeremy Nimmer <jeremy.nimmer@tri.global>
* [feature] TBD [tools,cmake] [cmake] Add support for BYO Python ([#19023][_#19023])  # Breaking changes: - Drop support for multi-config generators aka CMAKE_CONFIGURATION_TYPES. Specifically, the Eclipse or XCode IDE generators are no longer supported. Other fixes: - Bump minimum CMake to 3.16 (per Ubuntu 20.04 Focal). - Do not use -Werror in CMake builds; only first-party Bazel builds from source should do that (i.e., Drake Developers & Drake CI). - When the requested CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE is unsupported, force it to "Release". - CMake verbosity enables --announce_rc as well. - Clarify which rcfiles are loaded in CMake builds. - Stop using chained imports; only the top-level file contains imports. - Move C++17 flags to focal-specific config file. - Drop Numpy from CMake python searching; we don't use it anymore. Non-functional changes: - Emit a WORKSPACE file and use --package_path in rcfile, to make it easier to customize the workspace and debug bazel commands manually. - Put the rcfile in the conventional place, so we don't need extra args to tell Bazel where it is. - Pass environment variables via rcfile for clarity and reproducibility. - Rename BAZEL_TARGETS to BAZEL_INSTALL_TARGET; it's impossible for this to ever have more than one item in the list. - Rename BAZEL_TARGETS_ARGS to BAZEL_INSTALL_ARGS; it's impossible for this to ever be something other than an install command.
* [fix] TBD [setup,tools] [setup] Drop vestigial meshcat dependencies ([#19080][_#19080])
* [fix] TBD [doc] Clarify stability policy for struct aggregate initialization ([#19145][_#19145])  # We need to be able to deprecate and remove fields that sit in the middle of a struct.
* TBD

## Build dependencies

<!-- <relnotes for workspace go here> -->

* [fix] TBD [workspace] Upgrade fcl_internal to latest commit ([#19006][_#19006])
* [fix] TBD [workspace,doc,setup,tools] [tools] Remove compile-time dependencies on lxml ([#19027][_#19027])  # Programs invoked at compile-time should only use standard Python modules for maximum portability. Luckily in this case, Python 3 ships with a (slightly less featureful) ElementTree implementation that we can use.
* [fix] TBD [workspace] Upgrade common_robotics_utilities to latest commit ([#19036][_#19036])
* [fix] TBD [workspace,manipulation,tools,examples,doc,geometry,multibody] [workspace] Elevate drake_models to public visibility ([#19104][_#19104])  # Update version control documentation to match. Simplify its package.BUILD.bazel, to better match how a bare ROS package would work (just a pile of bare files). Enhance the drake_bazel_installed workflow to provide drake_models as an external repository to avoid extra downloading at runtime. Remove the models pre-fetching from the drake_bazel_installed_test. We still meet the DRAKE_ALLOW_NETWORK=none criterion (i.e., PackageMap does not download anything) because the bazel repository rules fetch the models now, which isn't part of what's governed.
