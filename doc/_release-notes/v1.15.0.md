title: Drake v1.15.0
date: YYYY-MM-DD
released: YYYY-MM-DD

# Announcements

* Drake's sample models
  (e.g., ``package://drake/manipulation/models/jaco_description/...``)
  are in the process of moving into their own ``package://drake_models`` instead
  of ``package://drake`` ([#18955][_#18955], [#19046][_#19046],
  [#19104][_#19104], [#19160][_#19160]).
  * The ``drake_models`` package is not part of Drake's default install media
    (with the exception of the docker images, which still include the models).
    The first time any file there is used, the drake_model data will be
    downloaded automatically into the user's cache directory.
    * See [Environment Variables](/doxygen_cxx/group__environment__variables.html)
      documentation for how to disable automatic downloading.
  * This drastically reduces the size of a default Drake install, and brings
    ``pip install drake`` on par with the other install media.
  * For the moment, most mesh files and the Atlas models have been relocated to
    the new package. More files will follow in future releases.
* Drake's PackageMap now supports packages fetched from ``http://`` or
  ``https://`` URLs ([#18955][_#18955]). You can use this to fetch your own
  models on demand.
* When installing from source, Drake's CMake build allows compiling for any
  Python version >= 3.8 via ``-DPython_EXECUTABLE=/path/to/desired/python3``
  ([#19023][_#19023]).

# Breaking changes since v1.14.0

on API changes.

Recently we've clarified our stability policy for struct aggregate
initialization. See [#19145][_#19145] for the changes.
