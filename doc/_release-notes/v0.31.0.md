# Announcements

# Breaking changes since v0.30.0

* Any direct subclasses of `SolverInterface` need to implement the new
`ExplainUnsatisfiedProgramAttributes` ([#15028][_#15028])
* Systems now check their Contexts ([#15030][_#15030], [#15102][_#15102],
[#15098][_#15098], [#15181][_#15181], [#15129][_#15129])
    * This change alters the semantics of classes such as Context that are
    closely tied to individual System objects. In the unlikely event that you
    have implemented methods that create, destroy, or repurpose such objects,
    you will need to follow the
    [system compatibility interface concept](https://drake.mit.edu/doxygen_cxx/group__system__compatibility.html).
Although this is formally a breaking change without deprecation, we do not expect that it will affect any downstream users in practice.
* SDFormat 1.8 ([#15099][_#15099]):
    * Models nested via the `<include>` tag are no longer flattened,
which means each included model will have its own model instance.
    * `drake::multibody::Parser::AddAllModelsFromFile` now returns all added models including nested models Note: This does not use a custom parser for URDFs via libsdformat's Interface API, and thus may incur unexpected behavior when including URDF files from SDFormat pending the full resolution of [#14295](https://github.com/RobotLocomotion/drake/issues/14295).
