# Announcements

* TBD

# Breaking changes since v0.30.0

* Any direct subclasses of `SolverInterface` need to implement the new
`ExplainUnsatisfiedProgramAttributes` ([#15028][_#15028])
* SDFormat 1.8 ([#15099][_#15099]):
    * Models nested via the `<include>` tag are no longer flattened,
which means each included model will have its own model instance.
    * `drake::multibody::Parser::AddAllModelsFromFile` now returns all added models including nested models Note: This does not use a custom parser for URDFs via libsdformat's Interface API, and thus may incur unexpected behavior when including URDF files from SDFormat pending the full resolution of [#14295](https://github.com/RobotLocomotion/drake/issues/14295).

# Changes since v0.30.0

Fixes

* Improve documentation of `available()` vs `enabled()` ([#15114][_#15114], [#15152][_#15152])
* Ensure that `GetAllConstraints()` includes exponential cone constraints; before, they were excluded ([#15180][_#15180])
* Add missing semi-definite programming Python bindings (linear matrix inequality and diagonal dominance) ([#15150][_#15150])
* Add remaining Python bindings for `MathematicalProgram` ([#15167][_#15167])

## Multibody Dynamics

<!-- <relnotes for geometry,multibody go here> -->

* TBD optimization: resolve minor TODO in ManipulatorEquationConstraint ([#15047][_#15047])
* TBD [geometry] Wire up hydroelastic derivatives all the way through QueryObject ([#15040][_#15040])  # - Callback - Eliminate the "unsupported" scalar code - Correct bug in which a switch on enum had a default case. - Unit test adds AutoDiffXd scalar to tests and tests for *presence* of appropriately sized derivatives (indicating derivative propagation). - ProximityEngine - Correct error that hydroelastic geometry was omitted in ToAutoDiff() - Extend test to check for appropriately sized derivatives where expected. Previously, it expected an exception to be thrown. - QueryObject - Update documentation vis a vis scalar support
* TBD [geometry] Clean up geometry/proximity build dependencies ([#15057][_#15057])  # Proximity used general declarations on "//common" a fair amount. This led to overly expansive dependencies. This simply pares down the declared dependencies to be more specific.
* TBD Make CalcCenterOfMassPositionInWorld() and CalcCenterOfMassTranslationalVelocityInWorld() consistent with CalcTotalMass() ([#15054][_#15054])  # Resolve issue [#14997]: Update center of mass position calculations so they are consistent with CalcTotalMass().
* TBD [multibody,geometry,solvers,lcm,tools,tutorials] Repair typos ([#15063][_#15063])  # These were found with `codespell`: $ apt install codespell $ codespell -wi3 A few false positives (binary files, identifiers that look like words) were skipped.
* TBD [geometry] Corrects inconsistency in published/unpublished header files ([#15070][_#15070])  # There are a number of header files (that directly lead to including fcl) that are marked to be installed. However, there were three header files that *are* installed that included them directly. This removes those transitive references and shores up downstream code that lazily inherited headers via this path. Resolves #14792
* TBD Add features to PackageMap ([#15064][_#15064])  # - Makes PackageMap copy/move/assignable - Changes PackageMap::Add to allow duplicate (package, path) to be added without throwing - Adds PackageMap::AddMap to combine package maps - Adds PackageMap::GetPackageNames to enumerate the packages mapped by the map
* TBD multibody: Relocate many MbT method definitions to cc file ([#15078][_#15078])  # Add missing test case for mismatched Joint subclass.
* TBD [geometry] Calculate centroid and area of a convex polygon represented as an ordered list of vertex positions ([#15034][_#15034])
* TBD [geometry] Introduce new bounding volume: axis-aligned bounding box ([#15058][_#15058])  # 1. Moves the Gottschalk box-overlap test *out* of Obb and into its own file. This is *just* movement, no changes in implementation. - Note, we're still using the Obb tests to test this code. 2. Adds the Aabb bounding volume class. 3. Add overlap tests between Aabb and Obb. 4. In build, roll the bounding volumes into a single build target to mitigate interdependencies.
* TBD Add DiscreteUpdateManager and PhysicalModel ([#15033][_#15033])  # Add a DiscreteUpdateManager class that advances the discrete states for MultibodyPlant. DiscreteUpdateManager provides an interface that extends MbP and that MbP knows how to invoke. It allows more flexibility in experimenting with new solvers and can be compiled independently from MbP. Add a PhysicalModel class that extends the physical models owned by MultibodyPlant. It allows more flexibility in experimenting new materials and models that may be simulated. To enable DiscreteUpdateManager and PhysicalModel, introduce attorney classes MultibodyPlantModelAttorney and MultibodyPlantDiscreteUpdateManagerAttorney that grant the necessary protected/private methods in MultibodyPlant that PhysicalModel and DiscreteUpdateManager needs. Co-authored-by: amcastro-tri alejandro.castro@tri.global
* TBD [multibody,examples] multibody: implements DoCalcImplicitTimeDerivativesResidual for MBP ([#15048][_#15048])  # Resolves #13164
* TBD [hotfix] Fix a mac ci build - test tolerance was too tight ([#15094][_#15094])  # * Fix a mac ci build - test tolerance was too tight The mac (in debug) needed a bit more tolerance in the test.
* TBD multibody: Improve error messages on element lookups ([#15083][_#15083])  # Specifically, when the model instance filtering is misconfigured, provide more information about what models might have matched.
* TBD Relax the tolerance of a globak IK test ([#15097][_#15097])  # Hotfix for CI failure.
* TBD [geometry] Create general bounding volume hierarchy ([#15084][_#15084])  # * Create general bounding volume hierarchy The Bvh code is now templated on bounding volume type so the same *hierarchy* logic can be used for different bounding volume types. Furthermore, support collision *between* hierarchies of different bounding volume types (in so far as the bounding volumes themselves support overlap tests. The majority of the meaningful changes are in: bvh.{h|cc}, obb.h and bvh_test.cc. All other changes are simply respellings of the Bvh invocation to account for the change in type declaration.
* TBD [geometry] Utility to add one representative triangle for each contact polygon ([#15035][_#15035])  # It will help speed up discrete hydroelastic contact model.
* TBD Refactor SoftsimSystem ([#15088][_#15088])  # Split SoftsimSystem into two classes. 1. DeformableModel inherits from PhysicalModel and provides capabilities to model deformable bodies. 2. DeformableRigidManager inherits from DiscreteUpdateManager and manages discrete updates for two-way coupled deformable rigid systems. Updates `run_cantilever_beam` to reflect the refactor. Address Alejandro's feedback
* TBD Adding collision filter manager API ([#15115][_#15115])  # In anticipation of expanding the functionality relating to working with collision filters, we're changing the public API. This introduces a *parallel* API and labels the old API as "legacy". The legacy API will be deprecated in a follow up PR. The purpose of the API is to reduce SceneGraph's knowledge of working with collision filters. SceneGraph produces a CollisionFilterManager, but all manipulation of collision filter configuration now belongs to that manager (reducing the churn on SceneGraph's already large API). To achieve this end: - Introduce new classes: CollisionFilterManager and CollisionFilterDeclaration. - The unit tests for CollisionFilterManager are copied from scene_graph_test.cc (as the manager can only be constructed by SceneGraph). The source test code is marked as Legacy for future deprecation. - Add new API: SceneGraph::collision_filter_manager(). - GeometryState updates API to support new manager/declaration API. This does *not* include bindings. Those will be included when we deprecate the legacy API.
* Add support for SDFormat 1.8 model composition ([#15099][_#15099])

* TBD Add support for parsing acceleration limits for some joints in URDF and SDF ([#15122][_#15122])
* TBD multibody tree: Validate contexts at public methods ([#15129][_#15129])  # Closes #11252. Since all of the context-taking methods in multibody/tree lead eventually to MultiBodyTreeSystem, ensure that all of its public methods validate the context.
* TBD Remove DeclareCacheEntry() from DiscreteUpdateManager attorney ([#15132][_#15132])  # DeclareCacheEntry() does not need to be exposed to DiscreteUpdateManager through the attorney class because it is public to begin with.
* TBD Revert "Adding collision filter manager API" ([#15139][_#15139])  # * Revert "Adding collision filter manager API (#15115)" This reverts commit e4d98c8c5c77f19152f32fcca4fb719081536f7c.
* TBD Support rigid dofs update in DeformableRigidManager ([#15123][_#15123])  # Copy the contact solve logic for rigid dofs in MultibodyPlant to DeformableRigidManager. Add unit test to verify that when only rigid dofs exist, the simulation results obtained through the discrete update manager is the same as that obtained from internal MultibodyPlant logic.
* TBD [geometry,multibody] Replaces calls to ComputeBasisFromAxis in favor of MakeFromOneVector() ([#15055][_#15055])  # Replace calls to ComputeBasisFromAxis() in favor of MakeFromOneVector().
* TBD geometry: Use C++17 spellings for type_traits ([#15149][_#15149])
* TBD Manage collision geometries with DeformableRigidManager ([#15128][_#15128])  # - Add RegisterCollisionObjects() that registers all rigid collision geometries registered in MultibodyPlant at the corresponding DeformableRigidManager. - Add RegisterDeformableGeometries() that registers all deformable geometries from DeformableModel at the corresponding DeformableRigidManager. - Add UpdateCollisionOjbectPoses() and UpdateDeformableVertexPositions() that update the geometries based on context. This is meant to be a temporary solution while SceneGraph doesn't support deformable geometries yet. When SceneGraph takes control of deformable geometries, much of the code here can be migrated to SceneGraph with some modifications.
* TBD multibody: Use C++17 spellings for type_traits ([#15153][_#15153])
* TBD [geometry] Make a deformable volume mesh ([#15117][_#15117])  # - Introduce the generic MeshDeformer abstract. - It is compatible with both SurfaceMesh and VolumeMesh. Each have been modified to support the deformer. - Add the DeformableVolumeMesh - Wraps a VolumeMesh with a corresponding MeshDeformer and provides an API for updating vertex positions. - Incidentally extends the VolumeMesh::Equal() method to include a tolerance between vertex positions. In the near future, a "deformable" bvh will be added as well.
* TBD Allow to everestimate the capacity for block sparse matrices ([#15162][_#15162])
* TBD multibody/test: Fix constant name style ([#15172][_#15172])
* TBD geometry: Remove redundant type annotation for DeclareCacheEntry ([#15174][_#15174])
* TBD multibody/tree: Clarify that continuous/discrete mode is invariant ([#15173][_#15173])  # It took me a few minutes to reason out whether or not this could ever change out from under us.  I'm saving the next reader that trouble.
* TBD :pencil: Fixed typo deend -> depend ([#15183][_#15183])
* TBD Implements continuosly differentiable atan(x)/x ([#14963][_#14963])
* TBD multibody/plant: Remove redundant syntax for DeclareCacheEntry ([#15176][_#15176])
* TBD [geometry] Parameter to select output format from mesh intersection ([#15131][_#15131])  # summary: 1. New parameter for ComputeContactSurfaceFromSoftVolumeRigidSurface() to choose between two representations of contact polygons. 2. Refactoring to create a test fixture that is shared between two functions that use the new parameter.
* TBD [multibody,systems] Support scalar conversion for external multibody plant components ([#15135][_#15135])  # To that end: * Add ScalarConvertibleComponent base class that PhysicalModel and DiscreteUpdateManager inherit from. * Add CloneToScalar() method for PhysicalModel and DiscreteUpdateManager. * Add Remove() overload to SystermScalarConverter to prevent scalar conversion to scalars not supported by certain components. Miscellaneous: Change names of experimental functions in MultibodyPlant to abide GSG.
* TBD Calculate deformable rigid contact pair ([#15160][_#15160])  # Add DeformableRigidManager::CalcDeformableRigidContactPair() that calculates the contact information between a deformable body and a rigid collision geometry. It wraps around ComputeTetMeshTriMeshContact() to provide additional information about the contact such as friction, stiffness, dissipation, and the rotation matrices to transform world frame quantities into contact frames.
* TBD [multibody] Tidy up attorney declaration order ([#15193][_#15193])
* TBD Change MbP component setters' signature ([#15195][_#15195])  # * Change SetContactSolver(), AddPhysicalModel(), and SetDiscreteUpdateManager() to void methods that take a unique pointer to the base class. * Move definition of these methods to .cc file to comply with GSG.

## pydrake bindings

<!-- <relnotes for bindings go here> -->

* TBD pydrake: In pydrake.all, prefer pydrake.math over pydrake.symbolic ([#15052][_#15052])
* TBD pydrake: Remove spurious documentation header dependencies ([#15068][_#15068])  # These were added in 6f37fd67 at a time when our pydrake linking was broken. We were linking the examples' libraries outside of libdrake.so, so their headers were not part of libdrake's headers, so for mkdoc to find them we needed to list them here individually. Now that we link the examples correctly (i.e., directly into libdrake.so), we no longer need to feed the redundant dependencies to mkdoc. As of bazel 4.1, the redundant headers actually break mkdoc, because we try to add these headers twice, with the second path spelling not matching any valid include path.
* TBD Remove two boxes static equilibrium test in Python ([#15076][_#15076])  # The logic is already tested in C++ with two spheres.
* TBD pydrake: Add bindings for SolverInterface::enabled ([#15107][_#15107])
* TBD Remove deprecated code 2021-06 ([#15108][_#15108])
* TBD pydrake doc: Add mention about binding dependencies on public API ([#15100][_#15100])  # Part of this is specific to pydrake bindings, but can still be helpful for pybind11 in general.
* TBD solvers: add missing binding for AddLinearCost ([#15127][_#15127])
* TBD bind Monomial() constructor ([#15136][_#15136])
* TBD Add python binding for monomil * float -> polynomial ([#15138][_#15138])
* TBD solvers: reorder bindings to match order in mathematical_program.h ([#15141][_#15141])
* TBD Add python binding for LinearMatrixInequalityConstraint ([#15146][_#15146])
* TBD bindings: Use C++17 spellings for type_traits ([#15156][_#15156])

* TBD mkdoc: Work around a problematic deprecation_example header dep ([#15069][_#15069])  # When collecting the list of package headers, in the case of the deprecation example (which has no package library) we were ending up with two different copies of the header being passed to mkdoc: bazel-out/k8-opt/bin/bindings/pydrake/common/_virtual_includes/deprecation_example_class/drake/bindings/pydrake/common/test/deprecation_example/example_class.h bindings/pydrake/common/test/deprecation_example/example_class.h The first one is the path we want -- the one used while compiling, and thus the one with a matching -I flag.  The second one is a correct dependency, but not used for compiling, so does not have any -I flag, so breaks mkdoc. Here, we customize our skylark header collection to ignore the second file.
