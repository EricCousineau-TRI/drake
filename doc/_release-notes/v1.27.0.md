title: Drake v1.27.0
date: 2099-12-31
released: YYYY-MM-DD
---

# Announcements

* Drake no longer supports Ubuntu 20.04 ("Focal") ([#20952][_#20952]).
  * End of life timelines are documented as part of the
    [Supported Configurations](https://drake.mit.edu/installation.html#supported-configurations).
  * As a result, we have some new lower bounds on supported tool versions ([#21107][_#21107]):
    * C++ standard >= 20
    * GCC >= 11
    * Clang >= 14
    * Bazel >= 6.0
  * Remove drake_visualizer ([#20963][_#20963])
* On macOS our primary Python version is now 3.12 ([#21013][_#21013])
  * Building from source via Bazel defaults to 3.12, but is configurable.
  * Drake wheels still supported and distributed for both 3.11 and 3.12.
  * The drake binaries tarballs (``*.tgz``) are 3.12 only.
* On macOS, some support has reached end of life:
  * Drake's support for Monterey (i.e., macOS 12) reached end of life in Drake
    v1.22.0. We have continued to ship some Monterey packages as a courtesy, but
    this be the last release to do so.
  * Drake's support for running on ``x86_64`` reached end of life in Drake
    v1.22.0. We have continued to ship x86 packages as a courtesy, but this will
    be the last release to do so. In the future, we will only ship ``*.whl``
    packages for macOS x86_64 (not ``*.tgz`` packages), and only for stable
    releases (no more nightly builds).
  * We are no longer running CI testing on macOS ``x86_64``, except for the
    minimal recipe that compiles the wheel packages.

# Breaking changes since v1.26.0

* The ``drake_bazel_installed`` installation workflow is deprecated and no
  longer tested in CI ([#21057][_#21057])
  * This particular workflow for using Drake binaries via Bazel is characterized
    by a line like this in your ``WORKSPACE`` file:
    ```py
load("@drake_binary//:share/drake/repo.bzl", "drake_repository")
```
  * During the deprecation window we will continue to install the code in case
    it still happens to work for you, but we are no longer testing it in our CI
    so it will probably bitrot at some point.
  * For Bazel users who only need pydrake, note that the rules_python support
    for pip wheel is pretty good these days; using the pydrake wheels via
    rules_python is a good option.

Refer to our [Drake Stability Guidelines](/stable.html) for our policy
on API changes.

* [fix] TBD add finiteness check to linear constraints ([#21049][_#21049])  # add finiteness check to linear constraints
* [fix] TBD Fix a logic bug when constructing an AffineSubspace as the affine hull of a ConvexSet ([#21009][_#21009])  # The logic previously used to construct the affine hull had an error where not all the vectors of the basis will be found. Co-authored-by: amice <amice@mit.edu>

## Multibody Dynamics and Geometry

<!-- <relnotes for geometry,multibody go here> -->

* [fix] TBD [geometry] Fix lights expressed in camera frame for RenderEngineVtk ([#20930][_#20930])  # * Fixes VTK illumination bugs See the documentation in fix_illumination_bugs.patch for details. But this corrects: 1. Missing tests on the "positionality" of a light, 2. Computation using uninitialized memory. * Fix lights expressed in camera frame for RenderEngineVtk The old code misrepresented the device frame; it was incomplete. It flipped to left-handed when it is more accurate to rotate the around Cx 180 deg. This also changes the light direction vector semantics. The input value need not be unit length, just normalizable. RenderEngineVtk had to change what it was doing, but RenderEngineGl was already doing this. Only its test was expanded to explicitly cover normalization.
* [fix feature] TBD [multibody,geometry] [parsing] Add collision filter member groups ([#20925][_#20925])  # This patch allows collision filter groups to add the members of other groups by naming the group, instead of (previously) re-iterating all of the member links. Since groups naming other groups induces an arbitrary graph at resolution time, do the proper graph math for reasonably efficient resolution. Graph cycles are permitted. Implement and test parsing support in URDF, SDFormat, and Drake Model Directives. As a bonus, fix a pre-existing bug that allowed duplicate group definitions to silently replace any previous definitions.
* [feature] TBD Add rpy_floating_joint ([#20912][_#20912])  # Generalizes the notion of a floating joint now that there are two kinds.
* [feature] TBD [geometry,workspace] Introduce shadow maps in RenderEngineVtk ([#20944][_#20944])  # Meta note: this entailed efforts in three types of changes: - Designed changes to Drake - Bug fixes for VTK - Regrettable hack around VTK to accommodate for bugs that could not otherwise be resolved yet. Designed changes for Drake: - RenderEngineVtkParams has three new properties: exposure, cast_shadow, and shadow_map_size. - RenderEngineVtk - Replace the hard-coded VTK OpenGL render pipeline with a custom sequence of render passes. - Note: tests on the engine show that the hard-coded pipeline has correctly been reproduced given the default engine parameters. - The new pipeline includes shadow maps and tone mapping. - Incidentally, modernize the technique for initializing VTK's OpenGL infrastructure. - Testing has been updated to exercise the new parameters and confirm effect. - It also expanded the single-image tests to include transparent objects. - The reference images have all changed: - the rows have moved to better accommodate additional geometry - added new geometry to test of transparent objects - shadows enabled - adding the "ground" last changed label assignment VTK bug fixes The details are in the .patch files. But we correct camera copying and various details of the shadow map shader implementations. VTK hacks - There is a known bug in VTK where shadow maps on a render window that isn't square, gets incorrectly mapped to the world. The cause is still unknown. So, when enabling shadows, we render to a square window and then extract the original image dimensions.
* [feature] TBD Adds MultibodyPlant::MakeActuationMatrixPseudoinverse ([#20975][_#20975])
* [newly deprecated] TBD Support relative frames in DifferentialInverseKinematicsIntegrator ([#20973][_#20973])
* [feature] TBD Implements PackageMap::ResolveUrl() ([#21042][_#21042])  # Adds a new PackageMap sugar function that takes a string url as input and returns the resolved path. Resolves #20255.
* [feature] TBD [multibody] Add spatial inertial minimum length methods methods ([#20897][_#20897])  # This PR adds a simple inexpensive calculation that infers a  minimum physical length from a spatial inertia. Given recent misadventures with preposterously large spatial inertia, the new function herein is a step toward further sanity checking, to be integrated in later work. Co-Authored-By: mitiguy <paul.mitiguy@tri.global>
* [fix] TBD mujoco parser assigns unique names to default geometries ([#21045][_#21045])  # Previously, we failed when parsing https://github.com/google-deepmind/mujoco_menagerie/blob/d1e7d67/aloha/scene.xml with a message of the form "already has a geometry named geom0".
* [feature] TBD Drake-generated meshes render faceted in meshcat ([#21021][_#21021])  # When Meshcat sends a Drake-generated mesh (as indicated by a call to a SetTriangleMesh() variant), that mesh's material is configured to render the mesh faceted. The default behavior of smoothing them is unhelpful. Meshes of strongly angular objects (e.g., boxes) have their creases smoothed over. It can be difficult to fully understand the topology of the generated mesh with smoothing.
* [newly deprecated feature] TBD [multibody] Make joint damping a system parameter ([#20947][_#20947])  # [multibody] Make joint damping a system parameter In `Joint` and its subclasses, we generally replace `damping()`, `damping_vector()`, etc. with `default_damping()`, `default_damping_vector()`, etc. via deprecations. The full list of deprecations is given in the main PR comment thread. Context dependent damping getters and setters are added in `Joint`, `RevoluteJoint`, `PrismaticJoint` and `ScrewJoint`.
* [fix] TBD [geometry,workspace] Upgrade meshcat to latest commit ([#21080][_#21080])  # This includes an update to meshcat_manual_test to exercise meschat's newest feature via the Drake API (and some instruction clean up).
* [feature] TBD Adds support for <include> tags in the mujoco parser ([#21087][_#21087])  # Resolves #20683.
* [feature] TBD SceneGraph makes use of the convex hull for visualization ([#21061][_#21061])  # - GeometryState computes the convex hull (and reports it). - InternalGeometry stores the convex hull. - MeshcatVisualizer uses the convex hull when appropriate. - ProximityEngine reports if it would use a convex hull. - SceneGraphInspector reports possible convex hull. - New code converts from polygonal surface mesh to triangle surface mesh. - update box.sdf to include collision geometry.
* [fix] TBD [geometry,workspace] [render_vtk] Obey extensionsUsed and extensionsRequired ([#21090][_#21090])  # When given a glTF with an unsupported extensionsRequired, throw an error. (Previously, we would print an error to stderr but bash on regardless.) When given a glTF with an unsupported extensionsUsed (not required), don't report errors about known image formats (e.g., ktx2), rather only about images we need but cannot actually load. The warning about the unsupported texture extension is sufficient on its own.
* [feature] TBD [geometry,multibody] [geometry] Allow tiny compliant primitives to vanish ([#21100][_#21100])  # Some model files intended for use with point contact are festooned with "tiny bubbles" -- zepto-volume primitives (usually spheres) that help stabilize unstable contact configurations. These geometries cause problems when attempting a naive conversion to hydroelastic contact. For any such geometries marked compliant, Drake would attempt to build a volume mesh with a pressure field. These attempts fail because the gradient computations are numerically unsound. This patch ushers in a more forgiving world, where such tiny geometries are declared to vanish, and no longer participate in contact queries. It is part of a larger campaign to enable a simpler path to getting started with hydroelastic contact simulation.
* [feature] TBD MakeConvexHull now supports glTF files ([#21131][_#21131])  # We're using VTK to parse the glTF file. For VTK's parser to work, it needs the OpenGl2 rendering artifacts initialized. This required moving VTK module initialization out of `internal_render_engine_vtk.cc` and into its own compilation unit to be shared. It exercises the API in planar_scenegraph_visualizer. While the API could probably be promoted to part of the stable API, that decision is being deferred for now. It is bound as _MakeConvexHull.

## Planning

<!-- <relnotes for planning go here> -->

* [feature] TBD Unwrap gcs trajs with continous revolute joints to continous Euclidean space ([#21137][_#21137])  # * Unwrap GCS trajectories with continous revolute joints into continous Euclidean space * address comments * remove empty traj case * buildifier on build * address platform comments * fix comment
* [feature] TBD enable solving a path via convex restriction ([#20895][_#20895])
* [feature] TBD Return bindings from KinematicTrajectoryOptimization Add* methods ([#21014][_#21014])  # Resolves 20894.
* [feature] TBD [planning,solvers,tools] Add new algorithm, IrisInConfigurationSpaceFromCliqueCover, for efficiently placing IRIS regions ([#20831][_#20831])  # Also adds a new subdirectory planning/iris This algorithm attempts to cover a large portion of the free configuration space in as few IRIS regions as possible. It builds a visibility graph, constructs a small clique cover of the visibility graph, and uses the resulting cliques to position and direct IRIS region growth. Note: This does not change the existing IRIS implementation.
* [feature] TBD [planning,solvers] Implement wraparound edges together with the subspace machinery ([#20886][_#20886])
* [feature] TBD enable removal of subgraphs ([#21006][_#21006])
* [] TBD Add comment that IrisInConfigurationSpaceFromCliqueCover does not obe… ([#21033][_#21033])  # Add comment that IrisInConfigurationSpaceFromCliqueCover does not obey collision checker padding
* [feature] TBD Implements MaxCliqueSolverViaGreedy a greedy heuristic for obtaining large maximal cliques ([#21097][_#21097])  # 1. Implements MaxCliqueSolverViaGreedy, a greedy heuristic for approximating solutions to the maximum clique problem. 2. Updates default MaxCliqueSolver for IrisInConfigurationSpaceFromCliqueCover to MaxCliqueSolverViaGreedy in order to remove dependency on the proprietary MIP solvers.

## Tutorials and examples

<!-- <relnotes for examples,tutorials go here> -->

* [feature] TBD [tutorials,workspace] [tutorials] Hydroelastic Contact: Nonconvex Mesh ([#20774][_#20774])
* TBD

## Miscellaneous features and fixes

<!-- <relnotes for common,math,lcm,lcmtypes,manipulation,perception,visualization go here> -->

* [feature] TBD [common,geometry,workspace] [yaml] Improve variant support for primitive types ([#20937][_#20937])
* [fix] TBD [manipulation,workspace,doc,multibody,tools] [tri_homecart] Move to drake_models package ([#21004][_#21004])  # Update drake_models to latest commit. For example, users should now load package://drake_models/tri_homecart/homecart.dmd.yaml instead of package://drake/manipulation/models/tri_homecart/homecart.dmd.yaml
* [feature] TBD Implements DerivativeTrajectory ([#21036][_#21036])  # Trajectory objects provide derivatives by implementing `DoEvalDerivative` _and_ `DoMakeDerivative`. `DoEvalDerivative` evaluates the derivative value at a point in time. `DoMakeDerivative` returns a new Trajectory object which represents the derivative. In some cases, it is easy to implement `DoEvalDerivative`, but difficult or inefficient to implement `DoMakeDerivative` natively. And it may be just as efficient to use `DoEvalDerivative` even in repeated evaluations of the derivative. The %DerivativeTrajectory class helps with this case -- given a `nominal` Trajectory, it provides a Trajectory interface that calls `nominal.EvalDerivative()` to implement `Trajectory::value()`. Resolves 20982.
* [feature] TBD Promote SimIiwaDriver to public API ([#21040][_#21040])
* [fix] TBD [common] Adjust FindResource on installed Drake to chase symlinks ([#21092][_#21092])  # In case the user had set up any symlinks to help load Drake's runtime libraries, the logic to find the neighboring `$prefix/share` would fail to find the neighbor. Here we add a second attempt to find the `share` tree after resolving all symlinks in the library path. This should only add new capability, not break anything that is already working properly.
* TBD

## pydrake bindings

<!-- <relnotes for bindings go here> -->

* [fix] TBD Bind GetVisualGeometriesForBody ([#21153][_#21153])
* [fix] TBD Bind CalcPrincipalSemiDiametersAndPoseForSolidEllipsoid ([#21149][_#21149])  # Co-authored-by: Jeremy Nimmer <jeremy.nimmer@tri.global>
* [fix] TBD [py visualization] Avoid runpy warning due to import order ([#20968][_#20968])  # When downstream code invokes meldis (or similar) using runpy, they would see this warning: `RuntimeWarning: 'pydrake.visualization.meldis' found in sys.modules after import of package 'pydrake.visualization', but prior to execution of 'pydrake.visualization.meldis'; this may result in unpredictable behaviour`. We can avoid that by importing the command-line modules during all.py instead of during their parent module's import.
* [feature] TBD [mesh_to_model] Warn about implausible scale ([#20966][_#20966])  # Wavefront .obj files do not specify or store units for the vertex vectors, and different tools use different units. It is impractical and imprecise to try to infer units from comments that might be in the input file (though some software tries): https://stackoverflow.com/questions/47995531/three-js-load-proper-model-scale-size Instead, this patch checks the volume of the output against implausibly large and small volumes, and issues warnings.
* [feature] TBD Convert Drake ExpressionKind.Constant to Sympy Integer and Float ([#20996][_#20996])
* [feature] TBD [visualization] Allow adding triad to multibody Frame ([#21064][_#21064])
