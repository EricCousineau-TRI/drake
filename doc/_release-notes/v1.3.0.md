released: YYYY-MM-DD
---

# Announcements

  Clang 9 ([#16937][_#16937]).

# Breaking changes since v1.2.0

* None

Refer to our [Drake Stability Guidelines](/stable.html) for our policy
on API changes.

# Changes since v1.2.0

## Dynamical Systems

<!-- <relnotes for systems go here> -->

* TBD [systems] Controllability and observability for discrete-time systems ([#17029][_#17029])

New features

* TBD

Fixes

* TBD

## Mathematical Program

<!-- <relnotes for solvers go here> -->
Major improvement: speeding up parsing some types of MathematicalProgram, including parsing large amount of linear constraints in the symbolic form, and constructing sum-of-squares (sos) problems.

* Speedup MathematicalProgram::NewFreePolynomial ([#17011][_#17011])  # 1. Construct the polynomial using map instead of adding each terms. 2. Use Variables.insert instead of += to avoid redundant copying
* Speed up computing polynomials using negation instead of subtraction ([#17013][_#17013])
* Return reference in operator+= and operator-= of symbolic::Variables ([#17018][_#17018])  # This avoid unnecessary copy when we return the result.
* Determine if a polynomial is even or odd ([#17021][_#17021])
* Polynomial evaluates a batch of indeterminates ([#17065][_#17065])
* Ipopt supports kPrintFileName ([#17034][_#17034])
* Exclude edges with ``phi=0`` constraint from optimization ([#17046][_#17046])
* Add PontryaginDifference to HPolyhedron ([#17056][_#17056])
* Make2NormSquaredCost should set convex flag to true ([#17074][_#17074])
* MosekSolver returns the solution even the problem is unbounded or infeasible ([#17089][_#17089])  # .
* AddEqualityConstraintBetweenPolynomials now returns linear equality constraints ([#17104][_#17104])
* Retrieve dual solution for positive semidefinite constraint in Mosek ([#17106][_#17106])
* Allow the user to specify the print out name of the Gram matrix ([#17114][_#17114])  # When adding SOS polynomial constraint, set the name of the Gram matrix. This is useful for debugging SOS.
* AddQuadraticAsRotatedLorentzConeConstraint takes optional psd_tol ([#17125][_#17125])  # When the minimal eigen value of Q is smaller than -psd_tol, then we throw an error. This helps when Q is computed numerically and being marginally psd.

New features

* TBD

Fixes

* TBD

## Multibody Dynamics and Geometry

<!-- <relnotes for geometry,multibody go here> -->

* TBD [multibody] APIs to set the default joint damping ([#17151][_#17151])

New features

* Add hydroelastic force and moment vector visualization ([#16913][_#16913])
* Add API to set strict parsing ([#17017][_#17017])
* Add ``Joint`` API to retrieve viscous damping ([#17019][_#17019])
* Implement a ``Wing`` class to provide basic aerodynamics ([#17027][_#17027])
* Move ``DifferentiableNorm`` to ``math`` and use it in ``Wing`` ([#17127][_#17127])
* Create methods for relative spatial acceleration to parallel spatial velocity ([#17117][_#17117])

Fixes

* Warn about unsupported URDF features and modify installed example files to remove unsupported elements that provoke warnings ([#16953][_#16953]) 
* Route package deprecations into the diagnostic channel ([#17047][_#17047])
* Prefer math::LinearSolver to plain eigen solvers when using autodiff ([#17038][_#17038], [#17057][_#17057])
* Change actuation port in MultibodyPlant not associated with any model instance to refer to all actuation ports instead of the only actation port ([#17059][_#17059], [#17107][_#17107])
* Emit errors for invalid SDFormat syntax instead of warnings ([#17060][_#17060])
* Warn about unsupported SDFormat features and modify installed example files to remove unsupported elements that provoke warnings ([#17101][_#17101]) 
* Move RenderEngineVtk into its own directory ([#17169][_#17169])

## Tutorials and examples

<!-- <relnotes for examples,tutorials go here> -->

* TBD [examples] Provide default values for actuation input ports ([#17145][_#17145])  # Previously, the AcrobotPlant example crashed if the input port was not properly connected.  I've provided default a input value for it here. And I've added them to PendulumPlant and CompassGait, too, for consistency.  The compass gait example, in particular, really should have had it... it's famous for being a passive dynamic walker! Related to #17025. Note: In jupyter (both deepnote and locally), the AcrobotPlant issue was manifesting as a completely silent kernel crash, with absolutely no hint/diagnositic.
* TBD Add MultibodyPlant simulation tutorial ([#17148][_#17148])
* TBD [examples/quadrotor] hotfix: fix segfault when QuadrotorPlant input port was not connected ([#17025][_#17025])  # Also fixes typo in input port name "propellor" => "propeller".
* TBD

## Miscellaneous features and fixes

<!-- <relnotes for common,math,lcm,lcmtypes,manipulation,perception go here> -->

* TBD Add Polynomial::Expand() ([#17156][_#17156])  # Expand each coefficient of the polynomial, remove the term if the expanded coefficient is zero.
* TBD

## pydrake bindings

<!-- <relnotes for bindings go here> -->

* TBD [pydrake] Remove StartMeshcat support for Google Colab ([#16949][_#16949])  # The master version of Drake can no longer run at all on Colab. (Drake's minimum Python version is 3.8 now.)
* TBD Add implicit dynamics binding ([#17032][_#17032])  # Co-authored-by: Jeremy Nimmer <jeremy.nimmer@tri.global>
* TBD [pydrake] Bind MbP::GetRigidBodyByName() ([#17042][_#17042])
* TBD [pydrake] Changing Python logging level also changes C++ level ([#17069][_#17069])  # Deprecate the confusing and now-superfluous pydrake set_log_level function. When using nicely formatted logging, emit "TRACE" not "Level 5".
* TBD Add python binding for Polynomial::EqualToAfterExpansion ([#17128][_#17128])
* TBD [pydrake] Add a few missing `rvp_copy` attributes ([#17126][_#17126])  # * [pydrake] Add a few missing `rvp_copy` I ran into this error working with `ExternallyAppliedSpatialForce`: ``` dtype = object arrays must be copied, and cannot be referenced ``` Once I understood the fix, I scanned quickly for other `.def_readwrite` statements that could have been missing the same, and found one more on that pass.

New features

* TBD

Fixes

* TBD

Newly bound

* TBD
* Add python binding for ToSymmetricMatrixFromLowerTriangularColumns ([#17111][_#17111])
* Add python bindings for Meshcat::SetCamera ([#17008][_#17008])

## Build system

* Add Bazel config for compiler selection ([#17043][_#17043])
* Fix some undefined behavior bugs identified by Clang 12 ([#17094][_#17094], [#17095][_#17095], [#17096][_#17096], [#17102][_#17102], [#17115][_#17115], [#17133][_#17133])
