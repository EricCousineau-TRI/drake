* TBD [systems,manipulation,multibody,solvers,tools] Remove deprecated code 2022-05 ([#17076][_#17076])

New features

* TBD

Fixes

* TBD

## Mathematical Program

<!-- <relnotes for solvers go here> -->
Major improvement: speeding up parsing some types of MathematicalProgram, including parsing large amount of linear constraints in the symbolic form, and constructing sum-of-squares (sos) problems.

* Speedup MathematicalProgram::NewFreePolynomial ([#17011][_#17011])  # 1. Construct the polynomial using map instead of adding each terms. 2. Use Variables.insert instead of += to avoid redundant copying
* Speed up computing polynomials using negation instead of subtraction ([#17013][_#17013])
* Return reference in operator+= and operator-= of symbolic::Variables ([#17018][_#17018])  # This avoid unnecessary copy when we return the result.
* Determine if a polynomial is even or odd ([#17021][_#17021])
* Polynomial evaluates a batch of indeterminates ([#17065][_#17065])
* Ipopt supports kPrintFileName ([#17034][_#17034])
* Exclude edges with ``phi=0`` constraint from optimization ([#17046][_#17046])
* Add PontryaginDifference to HPolyhedron ([#17056][_#17056])
* Make2NormSquaredCost should set convex flag to true ([#17074][_#17074])
* MosekSolver returns the solution even the problem is unbounded or infeasible ([#17089][_#17089])  # .
* AddEqualityConstraintBetweenPolynomials now returns linear equality constraints ([#17104][_#17104])
* Retrieve dual solution for positive semidefinite constraint in Mosek ([#17106][_#17106])
* Allow the user to specify the print out name of the Gram matrix ([#17114][_#17114])  # When adding SOS polynomial constraint, set the name of the Gram matrix. This is useful for debugging SOS.
* AddQuadraticAsRotatedLorentzConeConstraint takes optional psd_tol ([#17125][_#17125])  # When the minimal eigen value of Q is smaller than -psd_tol, then we throw an error. This helps when Q is computed numerically and being marginally psd.

New features

* TBD

Fixes

* TBD

## Multibody Dynamics and Geometry

<!-- <relnotes for geometry,multibody go here> -->

New features

* Add hydroelastic force and moment vector visualization ([#16913][_#16913])
* Add API to set strict parsing ([#17017][_#17017])
* Add ``Joint`` API to retrieve viscous damping ([#17019][_#17019])
* Implement a ``Wing`` class to provide basic aerodynamics ([#17027][_#17027])
* Move ``DifferentiableNorm`` to ``math`` and use it in ``Wing`` ([#17127][_#17127])
* Create methods for relative spatial acceleration to parallel spatial velocity ([#17117][_#17117])

Fixes

* Warn about unsupported URDF features and modify installed example files to remove unsupported elements that provoke warnings ([#16953][_#16953]) 
* Route package deprecations into the diagnostic channel ([#17047][_#17047])
* Prefer math::LinearSolver to plain eigen solvers when using autodiff ([#17038][_#17038], [#17057][_#17057])
* Change actuation port in MultibodyPlant not associated with any model instance to refer to all actuation ports instead of the only actation port ([#17059][_#17059], [#17107][_#17107])
* Emit errors for invalid SDFormat syntax instead of warnings ([#17060][_#17060])
* Warn about unsupported SDFormat features and modify installed example files to remove unsupported elements that provoke warnings ([#17101][_#17101]) 

## Tutorials and examples

<!-- <relnotes for examples,tutorials go here> -->

* TBD [examples/quadrotor] hotfix: fix segfault when QuadrotorPlant input port was not connected ([#17025][_#17025])  # Also fixes typo in input port name "propellor" => "propeller".
* TBD

## Miscellaneous features and fixes

<!-- <relnotes for common,math,lcm,lcmtypes,manipulation,perception go here> -->

* TBD [yaml] Deprecate YamlReadArchive and YamlWriteArchive ([#17084][_#17084])
* TBD

## pydrake bindings

<!-- <relnotes for bindings go here> -->

* TBD [pydrake] Remove StartMeshcat support for Google Colab ([#16949][_#16949])  # The master version of Drake can no longer run at all on Colab. (Drake's minimum Python version is 3.8 now.)
* TBD Add implicit dynamics binding ([#17032][_#17032])  # Co-authored-by: Jeremy Nimmer <jeremy.nimmer@tri.global>
* TBD [pydrake] Bind MbP::GetRigidBodyByName() ([#17042][_#17042])
* TBD [pydrake] Changing Python logging level also changes C++ level ([#17069][_#17069])  # Deprecate the confusing and now-superfluous pydrake set_log_level function. When using nicely formatted logging, emit "TRACE" not "Level 5".
* TBD Add python binding for Polynomial::EqualToAfterExpansion ([#17128][_#17128])
* TBD [pydrake] Add a few missing `rvp_copy` attributes ([#17126][_#17126])  # * [pydrake] Add a few missing `rvp_copy` I ran into this error working with `ExternallyAppliedSpatialForce`: ``` dtype = object arrays must be copied, and cannot be referenced ``` Once I understood the fix, I scanned quickly for other `.def_readwrite` statements that could have been missing the same, and found one more on that pass.

New features

* TBD

Fixes

* TBD

Newly bound

* TBD
* Add python binding for ToSymmetricMatrixFromLowerTriangularColumns ([#17111][_#17111])
* Add python bindings for Meshcat::SetCamera ([#17008][_#17008])
